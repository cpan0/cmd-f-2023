          <h2>ABOUT TUUM EATS</h2>
          <p>Here at UBC, our motto is ‚ÄúTuum Est‚Äù, which means ‚ÄúIt's yours, and it's up to you.‚Äù And with Tuum Eats, we want you to know the food is yours and the food is up to you. Our website scrapes Instagram to find campus gatherings where there will be free food students can eat because who doesn‚Äôt love free food? Additionally, a lot of groups find they have too much extra food at the end of the night, and the food would otherwise go to waste. Moreover, we also provided resources on our site to let UBC students know about other programs available for those experiencing food insecutrity, which we know is a serious problem for far too many students here. We hope to help them get the food they need so they can focus more on their studies and not how they‚Äôll get their next meal.</p>
          <h3>Meet Tom Ato! <Tom/> </h3> 
          <p>Your friendly neighbour Tom, the mascot of Tuum Eats! He‚Äôs here to fight for you and you right to have affordable food. Vote Tom for president.</p>
